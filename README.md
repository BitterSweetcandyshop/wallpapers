# wallpapers
r/unixporn discord's wallpaper channel collection plus personal finds
enjoy :3

This takes ages to update so it was last updated like mid march, I'll go through again later once I get a good playlist.

## Helping
anything in the unixporn\_wallpapers folder is open to be organized
- delete from unixporn\_wallpapers after moving
- put into whatever folders you see fit in unix\_sorted (dupes okay as long as it's not the same directory)
- accepted folders "types"?: color(s), color schemes, dark, light, just ask me
- don't rename files!

## Why isn't it sorted nerd? at least alpha-
wip, cope

## Add my wallpaper! (or suggest)
